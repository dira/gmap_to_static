h2. This is:

A bookmarklet that allows to get a static map out of a dynamic Google map, with just a click.

Go to "dira.ro/code/GMap-to-static":http://dira.ro/code/GMap-to-static/ and drag the bookmarklet to your Bookmarklet Holder Thingie.

It does markers:

And paths and shapes:

PS: one-click static maps creation is addictive.


h2. Technicalities

Some of the map information is available (the center and the map's geographical bounds). The rest is inferred as follows:
* the zoom is calculated with a magic formula depending of map's width, geographical bounds, and wisdom
* the markers, paths and shapes are found by recursively searching the map's properties until finding objects that quack like markers / paths / shapes (hack-ish!)
