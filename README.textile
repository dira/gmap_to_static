h2. This is:

A bookmarklet that allows to get a static map out of a dynamic Google map, together with its markers, with just a click.

Go to "http://dira.ro/code/gmap_to_static.html":http://dira.ro/code/gmap_to_static.html and drag the bookmarklet to your Bookmarklet Holder Thingie.

PS: one-click static maps creation is addictive.


h2. Technicalities

Some of the map information is available (the center and the map's geographical bounds). The rest is inferred as follows:
* the zoom is calculated with a magic formula depending of map's width, geographical bounds, and wisdom
* the markers are found by recursively searching the map's properties until finding objects that quack like markers (hack-ish!)
